This directory contains code to integrate the Cassandra service into OpenCloud
(http://www.opencloud.us/).

To enable in OpenCloud, copy the cassandra folders into your OpenCloud root
directory, which defaults to "/opt/planetstack". Then, edit
"<root>/planetstack/settings.py" and add the Cassandra service to "INSTALLED_APPS"
and "SUIT_CONFIG", like so:

> INSTALLED_APPS = (
>     ....
>     'cassandra',
> )
> 
> ....
> 
> SUIT_CONFIG = {
>     ....
>     'MENU': (
>         ....
>         {'label': 'Cassandra', 'icon':'icon-cog', 'app': 'cassandra'},
>     )
> }

In the cassandra_observer folder is the beginning of work towards creating an
observer to monitor and react to events affecting the Cassandra state in
OpenCloud. However, it is not yet complete nor fully tested as we couldn't
get the basic triggers to fire before fleshing out the rest of the code.
